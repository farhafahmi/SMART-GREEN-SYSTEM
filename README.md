The Smart Green System is an AI-powered precision agriculture solution designed to automate the identification of crops, weeds, and medicinal plants using deep learning and computer vision. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning models like MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet to analyze plant images and provide real-time predictions with high accuracy.

By integrating real-time image classification, IoT-based environmental sensing, and data augmentation techniques, the system enhances agricultural decision-making and sustainability. The project addresses key challenges such as class imbalance, computational efficiency, and scalability for low-resource environments.

The application offers a simple command-line interface with visual feedback via Matplotlib, and it is optimized for future deployment on mobile and edge devices. It also incorporates multilingual and voice support (planned), making it accessible to a wider farming community.

In the long run, this system aims to support smart farming by:

Diagnosing plant diseases early

Detecting weeds for targeted removal

Recognizing medicinal plants and their properties

Providing farmers with AI-based insights
